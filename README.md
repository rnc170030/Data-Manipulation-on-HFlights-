We will use Dplyr package in R to explore Hflights data set.

Below are some of the questions we addressed in this project:

# Which plane (by tail number) flew out of Houston the most times? How many times?
# Find the most visited destination for each carrier
# How many airplanes only flew to one destination from Houston?
# Find the carrier that travels to each destination the most etc
